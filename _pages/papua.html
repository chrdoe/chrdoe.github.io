<p>Working in Papua involves more than just data collection and linguistic research. Here are four videos to give you a little insight.</p>

<p>The first video is a narrative by Marua Bai about rain-making rituals in Rouku. This video was edited by Elena Weihe in an attempt to contextualize a recording session for a wider audience.</p>

<p>The second video is from a yam counting ritual in Rouku. This is the contribution from a single household for a larger feast. Yams are of special cultural importance. The counting procedure is also the origin of the senary (base-6) numeral system in most languages of the Yam family.</p>
