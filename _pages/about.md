Welcome to my self-promotional website, where I present my work as a linguist. My areas of research are [language documentation and description](https://ifl.phil-fak.uni-koeln.de/sites/linguistik/Personen/ASW/Himmelmann/Publikationen/2006-2010/Language_documentation_What_is_it_and_what_is_it_good_for_2006a.pdf), [comparative linguistics](https://hiphilangsci.net/2018/09/05/typology/), [linguistic complexity](https://doi.org/10.1075/slcs.71), ''[Papuan](https://halmahera.hypotheses.org/747)'' languages (especially in the south of the island of [New Guinea](https://maps.app.goo.gl/r8p2hNKBiLcF46of6)), multilingualism, face-to-face interaction. I am also interested in anthropology and ethnobiology.

I am currently employed at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Berlin, where I am a member of the DFG-funded research project [Open Text Collections](https://opentextcollections.github.io/).

Among the research results I wish to boast about are this [grammar of Komnzo](https://langsci-press.org/catalog/book/212) and this [article on vagina-words, bilingual placenames and esoterogeny](https://doi.org/10.1177/13670069211023158).

If I happen to be unresponsive to emails (especially in summer), it's probably because I am out [sailing](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-5esc0NTUb) this [Kosterbåt](files/trossö.pdf) from 1942.
