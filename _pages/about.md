Welcome to my self-promotional website, where I present my work as a linguist. My areas of research are language documentation and description, comparative linguistics, ``Papuan'' languages (especially in the south of New Guinea), face-to-face communication, and morphological complexity. I am also interested in anthropology and ethnobiology.

I am currently employed at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Berlin, Germany. I am working in the DFG-funded research project [Open Text Collections](https://opentextcollections.github.io/).
